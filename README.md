Hi, my name is Claire. my pronouns are She/Her. Very nice to meet you.

I have worked in IT infrastructure for over a decade with clients and employers in various medical, manufacturing, financial, fashion, and non-profit sectors.

We enjoy prototyping with new technologies, Game Design, VR Development, 3D printing, hardware, and electronics. Our goal is to learn as much as possible to save the world and then take over the world.

I'm not a programmer or developer. My GitHub likes to tell me otherwise.
